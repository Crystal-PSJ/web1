<p>Curating comment<br>
What I read today is about the difference between digital and publication writing and how narratives should be cared about. 2017 Google I/O said that the key factor to think about in digital writing is clarity/simple/usefulness, which provided a basis for why it's a key keyword.<br>
The biggest difference is that the reader perceives the publication as passive content (which is aimed at restraining & entertainment) that can follow the author's narratives, and the web as active content.</p>

<p>In Trend Korea 2019> explaining how to access generation-specific content, Generation X and Y are familiar with linear narratives such as books, and Generation Z is familiar with nonlinear narratives that go back and forth from the web to hyperlinks.<br>
The way you write depends on which platform you put the same 'writing', which points to the core of digital writing.</p>
